6/12/2017 17:28:46,1,1,1,7,7,1,1,4,It seemed like the robot didn't learn anything to be entirely honest.,0,A,18-24,Male,Yes,2,6
6/12/2017 17:45:52,5,3,6,3,1,7,5,6,"Definitely took much less effort than Method A to correct the robot's movement and it seemed to adapt to my changes unlike Method A which really didn't.",0,B,18-24,Male,Yes,5,3

6/13/2017 15:12:03,1,7,1,7,7,1,1,7,"The robot continuously fought me on every correction I tried to make leading me to feel like I needed at least a finger near one of the offending joints at all times.",3,A,18-24,Male,Yes,1,7
6/13/2017 15:28:40,5,3,7,3,3,5,5,6,"The no-spill experiment was most surprising it required very little interaction to get the robot to do what I desired. It was much trickier to get the robot to do what I wanted in the height experiment. The laptop experiment fell somewhere in the middle.",3,B,18-24,Male,Yes,6,2
6/13/2017 15:58:29,5,3,4,3,5,3,6,2,"While I did not feel like the robot was fighting my corrections I also corrected it in such a way that didn't really give the robot a chance to demonstrate its ""understanding."" This is why I could not rate it higher in terms of ""understanding""/""collaboration"".",4,B,25-34,Female,Yes,4,5
6/13/2017 16:12:22,1,7,1,7,7,1,6,2,"The robot had an idea of what it was going to do and it worked against my corrections trying to get back on ""it's pre-chosen track"" whenever I stopped correcting it.",4,A,25-34,Female,Yes,1,7
6/14/2017 11:24:29,5,3,4,3,3,3,3,5,"I felt as though results of my interactions were inconsistent between the two trials sometimes pleasantly surprising and sometimes not ""it's fighting me!""",5,B,25-34,Male,Yes,5,3
6/14/2017 11:39:26,1,7,2,6,7,1,6,2,"Method B felt like it had a more natural understanding of motion; I was able to guide it as if it were a human arm instead of tugging it around joint-by-joint. It also felt like method B incorporated my feedback into its trajectory plan while method A just kept returning to the spot I didn't want it resulting in more of a ""swat it away"" interaction instead of a ""show it how it's done""",5,A,25-34,Male,Yes,1,7
6/14/2017 13:21:08,5,3,6,5,3,4,2,4,between trials the response felt inconsistent,6,B,18-24,Female,Yes,2,4
6/14/2017 13:34:33,1,7,1,7,6,1,6,4,had to apply more force--felt as though it were fighting me to carry out the task the way it would normally perform it,6,A,18-24,Female,Yes,1,7
6/14/2017 14:23:16,5,3,2,5,3,5,5,5,"Most of the time the robot required minimal corrections. If I pushed it hard enough sometimes it would seem to fall into another mode and then do things correctly. Other times I'd move it and it'd be ""sticky"" coming back to the original trajectory and I kept having to correct it again. This stickiness was only really happening on the last task though where I was trying to keep it from hitting the laptop; otherwise it corrected pretty well. (Though not between trials.)",7,B,18-24,Female,Yes,3,6
6/14/2017 14:36:21,1,7,1,7,7,1,7,1,Robot didn't respond to corrections-- went back to previous path. It made it easy to predict though because it just meant I had to keep on correcting it periodically.,7,A,18-24,Female,Yes,1,7

6/14/2017 16:40:16,7,1,7,1,1,6,6,2,"Once I gave it a little correction the robot seemed to quickly figure out what I cared about and kept doing it on its own. It was pretty satisfying!",9,B,25-34,Male,Yes,7,1
