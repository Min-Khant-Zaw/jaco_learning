Timestamp,[Admin only] Participant ID,[Admin only] Method/Task Order,[Admin only] Task,[Admin only] Method,Age,Gender,Do you have a technical background?,I successfully taught the robot how to do the task. ,The robot correctly updated its understanding about aspects of the task that I did want to change.,The robot wrongly updated its understanding about aspects of the task I did NOT want to change.,"The robot understood which aspects of the task I wanted to change, and how to change them.",The robot misinterpreted my corrections.,"I had to try to undo corrections that I gave to the robot, because it learned the wrong thing.",Sometimes my corrections were just meant to fix the effect of previous corrections I gave.,I had to re-teach the robot about an aspect of the task that it started off knowing well.,"When the robot learned something wrong, it was difficult for me to undo that.",It was easy to re-correct the robot whenever it misunderstood a previous correction of mine.,Any overall comments?
